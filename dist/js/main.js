//idea for spinning performers
// pull all the li(s) as an array.

// if they are in the x spot(center spot depending on how many performers there are) of the array then give them a class of show-large if they aren't give them the class of show-small. You'll hide small and large accordingly and have them positioned ontop of each other

//on click of any of them also does this..ie makes them go into the center spot and get the class of large

//if there are more than 3 performers than hide the others (left/right) and push/pop the array items as it auto spins
